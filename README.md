# Solidity
Solidity is a high-level programming language designed for writing smart contracts on blockchain platforms like Ethereum. It enables developers to create decentralized applications (dApps) with self-executing code that runs on the blockchain. Known for its syntax similar to JavaScript, Solidity facilitates secure, transparent transactions and interactions in a trustless environment.
